# D-QCSP
Distributed Quay Crane Scheduling Problem using Distributed Constraint Optimization

In this project, a new distributed algorithm has been proposed in order to optimize and solve the QCSP as a distributed way. We assume that there are 4 agents (Quay Cranes) are processing on a single container ship at a same time.
